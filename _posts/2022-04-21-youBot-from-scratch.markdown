This project offers a detailed description to perform autonomous navigation using a KUKA youBot controlled via an external Laptop. This work was performed at RoboCup@Work Lab in Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. 

  
# Motivation

The intention behind performing this work is to get in-depth knowledge of `How to configure a robot with ROS from scratch`. For this purpose, we have used a **KUKA youBot** and an **external Laptop**. 

# Pre-requisites

* A KUKA youBot

* A laptop with the following specifications:
  * Ubuntu v18.04 
  * ROS Melodic Morenia
