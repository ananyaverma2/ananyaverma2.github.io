Lucy is equipped with an RGB-D sensor (Asus Xtion) with which it obtains the required data for carrying out many of its tasks. RGB-D sensors can be used to obtain both a regular color image of a scene and what is called a depth image, in which each pixel encodes distances to the camera's sensor; these distances are typically given with respect to a reference frame whose origin is at the location of the camera's sensor.

The images depicted below are the colored image and a representation of the depth image of the dinner table at the @Home Lab taken by Lucy.
